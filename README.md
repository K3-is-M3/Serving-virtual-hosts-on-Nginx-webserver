<h1>Hosting virtual hosts on nginx webserver</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a step-by-step process on how to set up nginx on your Linux server, configure your virtual hosts (domains/subdomains) correctly, and also procure SSL certs for them using the python-certbot package for nginx
<br />

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>nginx</b>
- <b>python3-certbot-nginx</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Ubuntu Linux</b> 

---

<h2>Installation & Setup Walk-through:</h2>

- <b>First make sure your repositories are up-to-date, then install nginx and python3-certbot-nginx</b>

### 1. Install nginx and python3-certbot-nginx
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx
```
Ensure nginx service is up and running; enable it as well to start on boot:
```
sudo systemctl start nginx; sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
Navigate to the sites-available folder in the nginx directory, where you will create the configuration file for your virtual host:
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano domain.conf 
```
Populate the configuration file with an Nginx virtual host template.
This initial setup listens on port 80 and serves traffic over the HTTP protocol.

Before proceeding, ensure youâ€™ve already created the appropriate A record for your domain or subdomain in your DNS or web hosting provider. This step is required for virtual hosting to function correctly in Nginx.
```
# ===========================
# Virtual Host (HTTP Only)
# ===========================

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name ##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;

    # If serving a frontend, use:
    # root /var/www//html;
    # index index.html;

    # Reverse proxy to backend (adjust port/IP as needed)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://SERVER_IP:PORT/;   # or your backend IP: PORT
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/api.support.numeraliot.com_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/api.support.numeraliot.com_error.log;
}
```
Save changes and quit

Next, create a symbolic link for the configuration file you created inside the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory.
This ensures that any updates made to your configuration file in the /etc/nginx/sites-available directory are automatically reflected in the active configuration used by Nginx.
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```
Verify your Nginx configuration for syntax errors.
If no issues are found, youâ€™re good to go â€” you can safely restart Nginx.
If there are any errors, theyâ€™ll be displayed in the terminal so you can identify and fix them before reloading the service.
```
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
Your web server is now partially configured and listening on port 80 (HTTP).
Next, letâ€™s secure it by enabling HTTPS so your site can serve encrypted traffic over port 443.

### 2. Run python3-certbot on your configured virtual host
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d domain.com -d www.domain.com
```
Below is what a successful SSL certificate request looks like in the terminal:
```
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for domain.com and www.domain.com

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2026-01-04.
These files will be automatically renewed every 90 days.

Deploying certificate
Successfully deployed certificate for domain.com to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/domain.conf
Successfully deployed certificate for www.domain.com to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/domain.conf
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on:
  - domain.com
  - www.domain.com

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Would you like to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS?
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access

Congratulations! Your HTTPS setup is complete.

Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem
Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem
Your web server has been configured to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Test your configuration at:

```

### 3. Test renewal simulation
```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
Expected output:
```
Congratulations, all simulated renewals succeeded.
```
ðŸ§¾ Notes for your the user

You can safely replace domain.com with **any placeholder** or your project subdomain.

No real DNS or SSL validation happens in the demo â€” itâ€™s purely a walkthrough simulation of a successful Certbot run.

### 4. etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.conf (after SSL setup)
```
# ===========================
# Virtual Host (HTTP + HTTPS)
# Auto-configured by Certbot
# ===========================

# --- HTTP configuration ---
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name ##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# --- HTTPS configuration ---
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name ##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;

    # SSL certificate files (managed by Certbot)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    # If serving a frontend, uncomment and adjust:
    # root /var/www/##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/html;
    # index index.html;

    # Reverse proxy to backend (adjust port/IP as needed)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://SERVER_IP:PORT/;  # backend IP and port
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/##YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE_error.log;
}

```
You should now be able to securely access your newly configured domain or subdomain through your web browser!
